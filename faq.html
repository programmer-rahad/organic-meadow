            <h3>Are your products GMO-free?</h3>
            <p>
              All Organic Meadow products are certified organic which means, by
              definition, they are always free of Genetically Modified
              Organisms. Under the Canadian Organic Standards, the use of GMO’s
              is not permitted. This means that the ingredients in our products
              and the food that we give our animals are not grown from GMO seed
              or produced with GMO products.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Are your products gluten-free?</h3>
            <p>
              All Organic Meadow products are gluten-free, except for kefir and
              ice cream. Our kefir cultures are grown in a facility where barley
              is present, and our ice cream is produced in a facility where
              gluten is present.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Are your products grass-fed?</h3>
            <p>
              Under Canadian Organic Standards, on an organic dairy farm, a
              minimum of 60% of cows’ diet must come from pasture and dried
              forage. The exact percentage of grass varies depending on the
              individual farm, season and nutritional needs of the cow. The cows
              are free roaming on grassy pastures during the warm months
              starting as soon as the grass has grown long enough for the cows
              to eat. This period, typically from mid-late May until late
              October, is often referred to as ‘Pasture Season’. In the winter,
              the cows still go outside (weather permitting) as it is required
              within the Canadian Organic Regime that cows have outdoor access
              year-round. Weather conditions and other factors can make it
              impossible for many of our farmers to grow and store enough
              top-quality forage to meet the needs of their cows all year long
              without the option of grain. In these circumstances, our farmers
              choose from a variety of organic grains, including oats, barley,
              peas, corn, and soybeans, to supplement the cows' diet and to make
              sure they stay healthy. Any grains that the cows are supplemented
              with come from 100% certified organic sources and often come
              directly from the same farm. The grains are GMO free.

            <h3>
              Are your products probiotic? / Do your products contain active
              bacterial cultures?
            </h3>
            <p>
              All Organic Meadow Kefir and Yogurt products are made with live,
              active bacterial cultures. Our organic kefir is proudly made with
              10 bacterial cultures and contains over 2 billion active cultures
              per 250mL serving. Our organic yogurt is made with 4 active
              bacterial cultures and our organic Greek yogurt is made with 2
              active bacterial cultures, each providing more than 1 billion
              probiotic bacteria per serving.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Are your products lactose-free?</h3>
            <p>
              We recognize that some people have a hard time digesting lactose,
              which is the natural sugar that is present in all cows’ milk. As
              such, we are proud to offer Canada’s first (and only) organic 2%
              lactose-free milk & yogurt products. To make it, we take our
              organic milk and add a natural enzyme called lactase which breaks
              down the lactose into easily digestible sugars, glucose and
              lactose. The lactase enzyme is permitted under the Canadian
              Organic Standards and is non-GMO.

            <h3>What is HTST Pasteurization?</h3>
            <p>
              High Temperature Short Time (or HTST as it is known in the
              industry) is a common method of pasteurization. Using this
              traditional method, milk is heated to a minimum temperature of
              72°C and held for a minimum of 16 seconds. The milk is pasteurized
              to kill any pathogenic bacteria that may be present. For our
              pasteurized HTST milk, it is common to find a date code between 20
              to 22 days from the date of manufacture. This ensures a fresh,
              wholesome dairy product.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is my carton of milk good past the best before date?</h3>
            <p>
              We cannot recommend consuming any milk product past the best
              before date. We guarantee its freshness up to the best before date
              if unopened. Once opened, a milk product is freshest tasting
              within 7 days.
            </p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is cheese made with unpasteurized milk safe to consume?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. Our aged cheddar cheeses are made from unpasteurized,
              heat-treated milk. Under the Canadian Food Inspection Agency
              regulations, cheese made from unpasteurized milk must be aged for
              a minimum of 60 days to ensure that all the natural cultures
              eliminate any undesirable bacteria. Our aged cheddars are aged a
              minimum of 3-12 months, far longer than the minimum requirement.

            <h3>Why does butter not have an expiry date?</h3>
            <p>
              The reason we do not put an expiry date on our butter is because
              it is depends on how the butter is stored - refrigerated or
              frozen. As such, the date coding shown on the butter refers to its
              date of production. The butter leaves the processing plant frozen.
              Once it gets to the stores it is up to the individual retailer how
              they want it stored (fridge or freezer).
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Here is how to read the code on the butter:</li>

              <li>
                Look at the first of two rows of numbers stamped on one of the
                sides of the butter package.
              </li>

              <li>An example is C00919.</li>

              <li>
                C stands for Culture. If it were salted butter it would start
                with an S.
              </li>

              <li>
                009 represents the 9th day of the year, which is January 9th.
              </li>

              <li>19 is the year.</li>

              <li>This production date is January 09, 2019.</li>

              <li>
                The estimated shelf life if kept in the fridge is 4 months. The
                estimated shelf life if kept frozen is up to 2 years.
